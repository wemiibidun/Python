'''
Create a function named count_first_letter that takes a dictionary named names as a parameter. 
names should be a dictionary where the key is a last name and the value is a list of first names. 
The function should return a new dictionary where each key is the first letter of a last name, 
and the value is the number of people whose last name begins with that letter.

# Write your count_first_letter function here:
def count_first_letter(names):
  letters = {}
  
  for key in names:
    first_letter = key[0]
    if first_letter not in letters:
      letters[first_letter] = len(names[key])
    else:
        letters[first_letter] +=len(names[key]) 
  return letters     


# Uncomment these function calls to test your  function:
#print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Lannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 4, "L": 3}
#print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Sannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 7}
