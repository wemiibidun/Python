'''
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. 
Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
'''
#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

total = 0
for number in range(1,101):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    total = total + number
print(f"The sum of even numbers is: {total}")
